# dvrk-cannulas

CAD models for da Vinci Classic custom cannulas.  These are can be used instead of the standard metal cannulas for research applications.  The main advantages are that these can guide the instruments without covering the shaft all the way to the RCM.   This repository contains 2 models, a fixed one and one with a hinge.  The model with a hinge is convenient for instruments with sensors attached near the tip that can be inserted through the 8+ mm opening of a normal cannula.

## Notes
To make sure, you will need:
* a 3D printer
* a 4mm tap to make the threads on the holders.  It is recommended to print the part vertically to get the best possible precision for the holes for the threads
