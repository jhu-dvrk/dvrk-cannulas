# dvrk-cannulas

CAD models for da Vinci Classic custom cannulas.  These supports can be used instead of the standard metal cannulas for research applications.  This repository contains 2 models, a fixed one and one with a hinge.  The model with a hinge is convenient for instruments with sensors attached near the tip that can be inserted through the 8+ mm opening of a normal cannula.

## Notes
To make these, you will need:
* 3D printer
* 4mm tap to make the threads on the holders.  It is recommended to print the parts vertically to get the best possible precision for the holes to be threaded
